# Python3 implementation this is to use itertools. 
# permutations as coded below: 

from itertools import permutations 
def largest(l): 
	lst = [] 
	for i in permutations(l, len(l)): 
		# provides all permutations of the list values, 
		# store them in list to find max 
		lst.append("".join(map(str,i))) 
	return max(lst) 

print(largest([54, 546, 548, 60])) #Output 6054854654
